<h1> How to make Macchiato Macarons:</h1>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<li> 3 large egg whites (100g) room temperature</li>
<li> ¼ cup granulated sugar (50g)</li>
<li> 1 ¾ cup powdered sugar (200g)</li>
<li> 1 cup superfine almond flour (110g) (if unable to find “superfine” it is recommended that you pulse the almond flour in a food processor first) </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder</li>

<h5> For the filling: </h5>
<li> ½ cup butter, room temperature</li>
<li> 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted</li>
<li> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

<h3> Directions </h3>
<li> Line a large baking tray with parchment paper. </li> 
<li> Using a fine mesh strainer, sift together the almond flour, confectioners sugar, and espresso powder in a medium bowl. Discard any large pieces that remain in the strainer. </li>
<li> In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add ⅓ of the granulated sugar and with mixer on high, continue to beat until egg whites are stiff peaks. Add another ⅓ of the sugar and beat again until egg whites are back to stiff peaks. Repeat with last ⅓ of sugar, beating until whites are shiny and fluffy. </li>
<li> Add the sifted ingredients to the bowl with the egg whites. With a rubber scraper, fold the mixture into the egg whites, about 35-45 strokes, or until the batter falls on itself but a slight peak remains (Do not overmix or batter will be too thin and runny). </li>
<li> Fill a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe batter onto prepared baking tray into 1 ½ inch disks. </li>
<li> Lift and drop the baking tray onto a hard surface 2-3 times to smooth out the batter and knock out any air bubbles. Allow cookies to rest at room temperature for one hour, until a skin forms on the surface of the cookies. </li>
<li> Preheat oven to 285˚F (140˚C) </li>
<li> To make the filling, beat the butter, confectioners sugar and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Set aside. </li>
<li> After about one hour, gently brush the top a cookie with your finger to check that a skin has formed. The batter should not stick to your finger, if it does, allow to set for an additional 15 minutes. </li>
<li> Bake cookies in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until the cookies peel away from the parchment when lifted. </li>
<li> Allow the cookie shells to cool completely. </li>
<li> Pipe the buttercream frosting onto the bottom side of a cooled shell and sandwich together with a similarly sized cookie. </li>
<li> Dust with optional cocoa powder. Enjoy! </li>
